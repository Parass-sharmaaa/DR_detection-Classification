# DR_detection-classification
Deep Learning Project created to detect the stage of Diabetes by using Fundus image of retina.

This repository contains the implementation of our project Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Detection and Classification, submitted by Paras Sharma, an Electronics and computer engineering (ENC) student from Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology (TIET), Patiala.
# Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among diabetic patients. Timely detection and intervention can prevent severe stages of DR. Our project leverages deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate the diagnosis and classification of DR into five distinct stages:

Stage 0: No DR

Stage 1: Mild DR

Stage 2: Moderate DR

Stage 3: Severe DR

Stage 4: Proliferative DR

This classification accelerates the diagnostic process, reduces the workload for ophthalmologists, and provides early detection for better treatment outcomes.
